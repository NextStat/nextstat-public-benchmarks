# Optional pinned deps for the ML suite (CUDA via JAX).
#
# This is a template: CUDA wheels depend on the CUDA major version (and driver).
# Follow the official JAX install guidance for your platform, then pin versions.
#
# Recommended default for CI GPU runners: Python 3.12.
#
# Typical CUDA12 install pattern:
#   pip install -r env/python/requirements.txt
#   pip install -r env/python/requirements-ml-jax-cuda12.txt
#
# Requires:
# - NVIDIA driver on the host
# - CUDA runtime compatible with the chosen jaxlib wheel
#
# See: https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
